## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was realy proud of completing this challenge, not becasue it was too difficult but becasue it was the first challenge that I coded without needing to refer to other solutions.

Being able to build something from start to finsih is truly amazing.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning to master the Grid, specifically I need to learn the alignment properties better so that I can start aligning properties without needing to try and test options and refering to documentation so much.


### Useful resources

I found the following two guides that were great:

Flexbox guide: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

Grid Guide: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/
